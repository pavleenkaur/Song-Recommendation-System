# Song-Recommendation-System
### Goal
Predict whether users listened to the first track recommended to them

### About the Challenge
A private Hackathon held at Analytics Vidhya to test the Machine Learning skills of its interns.
Feature Engineering is considered to be one of the most important aspects of any ML/DL problem. Utilising the same for this challenge, I managed to obtain the Top Rank with a Train Log Loss score of 0.53 and Test 0.57.<br>

### Problem Statement
Getting the perfect music recommendation is a challenging task. Who has never dreamt of laying back and listening to some music, while having no buttons to press at all and still getting the perfect tune? But what defines this perfect tune?
Deezer is a music streaming app, also available on the web. It proposes more than 43 million tracks and is available in more than 180 countries, through a free limited service and a premium offer. 

For this online challenge, Deezer wants you to look at Flow, its own music recommendation radio. The concept of Flow is simple: it uses collaborative filtering to provide a user with the music he wants to listen at the time he wants.... And if he does not want to listen to some specific tracks and skips songs by pressing the 'Next song' button, then the algorithm should detect it quickly. In this context, getting the first song recommendation right is really important.
